## Implementation Highlights

- single page application web client with React & Redux
- service oriented architecure backend
- REST for client server communication, JSON RPC for inter service communication
- scrape raw movie data from imdb
- provides processed imdb movies data with our movie service API
- persisted ElasticSearch for movie's database for optimized searching capability
- PostgreSQL for user's database

### User Stories

- users can register and log in to their account
- landing page has collections of movie for recommendations
- users can search for movies
- users can browse search result by pages
- users can select and view details of a movie
- users can see his/her history of browsed movie
- users can add or remove movie to his/her bookmark

### Current Plans for Expansion

- containerize services and database with Docker

### Future Plans for Expansion

- seperate search into its own service that utilize ElasticSearch, use Cassandra as persisted database for movie-service and sync data between ElasticSearch and Cassandra
- Machine Learning recommendation system?
- Machine Learning classification for recommended movie collections?
- scrape and stream videos for movies?
